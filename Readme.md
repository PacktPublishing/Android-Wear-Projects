This is the code repository for [Android Wear Projects](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/android-wear-projects?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787123229), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Android Wear Projects is your opportunity to step into the exciting new world of Android Wear app development. This book will help you to master the skills in Android Wear programming and give you a complete insight on wear app development.




## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
compile 'com.google.android.support:wearable:2.0.0' compile
'com.google.android.gms:play-services-wearable:10.0.1' provided
'com.google.android.wearable:wearable:2.0.0'
```

To be able to follow with this book, you need a computer with the latest Android Studio
version installed. You need internet to set up all the required SDK for Wear development. If
you have a Wear device to test the application, that would be good; otherwise, Android
Wear emulators will do the magic.
